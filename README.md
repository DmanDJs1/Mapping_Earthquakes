# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Programs/libraries/Tools : b flet.js library, Javascript, and HTML

## Overview

In this module, we used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. 
In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

Some of the tasks required for succefully completing this project included:

    * Creating popup information boxes on location
    * Plotting lines, points and polygons
    * Creating a toggle to enable the use to switch between earthquakes and tectonic information and ability to switch between map styles (ex: streets, satellite)
    * Making color changes to lines
    * Making color changes on marker types according to radius and earthquake magnitude
